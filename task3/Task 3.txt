1.	list of differences between 1.0 and 1.1

Byte ranges, content negotiation, chunked encoding, protocol switching, message integrity checks, digest authentication, proxy authentication, better cache management with etags, caching directives, multi-homed servers, persistent connections.

2.	How to pass user-data via GET? via POST? what is the diff?

Get request is safe otherwise post request is dangerous.

GET requests:
•	Can be cached;
•	Remain in the browser history;
•	Can be bookmarked;
•	Should  never be used when dealing with sensitive data;
•	Have length restriction;
•	Should be used only to retrieve data.
              POST requests:
•	Are never cached;
•	Do not remain in browser history;
•	Cannot be bookmarked;
•	Have no restrictions on data length.
    If it gonna be dangerous request use POST.
    If idempotency is undesirable   use POST.
    If it needs to transfer a file or a large amount of data  use POST.
    Other cases  use GET.


3.	Few samples of websites (and cases) where POST method are used.

Youtube use POST while watching live videos (streams), cause a large amount of data need to be transfer from web to client.

Facebook use POST when we transfer some files (pictures, docx, videos etc.).

POST also used in applications where we need to fill up some form, just like: “Name”, “Age” etc.
